# fx-unit

fx-unit wants to make unit testing JavaFX controllers simple as simple as possible: 
+ test early
+ write tests with at most no overhead
+ no complex dependencies
+ no dependencies in the application, at any time!

## Current State of the Project

The fx-unit project is currently in a proof-of-concept phase. It is used in several internal projects at Aeonium Software Systems, in order to evaluate the aproach. 

If you are interested, drop a message!
Within the next day, further documentation follows, and any comments are welcome.
