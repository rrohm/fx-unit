# fx-unit

fx-unit wants to make unit testing JavaFX controllers simple as possible: 
+ test early
+ write tests with at most no overhead
+ no complex dependencies for testing - currently none at all
+ no dependencies in the application, at any time.

## Current State of the Project

The fx-unit project is currently in a proof-of-concept phase. It is used in several internal projects at Aeonium Software Systems, in order to evaluate the aproach.

Within the next day, further documentation follows, and any comments are welcome.
